### [Warp](http://warp.dev)

1. `mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes` if the directory is not already created.
2. `cd ~/.warp/themes` and `git clone https://github.com/juliabresolin/warp-theme-dark-modern`.
3. Open `Warp > Settings > Appearance > Themes`, scroll all the way down to see new Dark Modern themes.

You might need to restart Warp for it to register the new themes as per [the documentation](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/custom-themes#how-do-i-use-a-custom-theme-in-warp).

> It may take several minutes for Warp to initially discover the new config directory. You can either wait or just restart the application. After that step, all future changes to `~/.warp/themes` directory will be reflected in Warp within seconds.

ðŸŒŸ If you like this theme, don't forget to give it a âœ¨ star âœ¨.
